### Hi!

I'm [JD](https://jdbriones.vercel.app), Full Stack Developer & Audio Engineer based in Auckland, New Zealand.

**Full Stack Developer**

I build and design modern, responsive websites with a strong focus on **animation, interaction, and performance**.  
Currently working toward a **front-end role**, creating polished UI experiences that feel smooth, intentional, and engaging.

My main tech stack is React, Tailwind, ASP.NET and Framer Motion

Currently Learning
- Advanced animation patterns  
- Front-end architecture & best practices
- UI/UX Design
- JUCE & C++ *(audio software development)*

Outside of web development, I work in audio and music:
- Music production
